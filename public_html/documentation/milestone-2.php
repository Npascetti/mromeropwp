			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I want to have an about me section for others to learn about who I am.</p>
			<h3>Portfolio</h3>
			<p>As you scroll there is my portfolio. It shows off my portfolio and websites and projects I have made. I want it to be a sliding image and to link to the actual sites.</p>
			<h3>Contact Form</h3>
			<p>This lets the user contact me through a contact form. I will also have links to multiple 				social media. I will also have my information posted as well such as phone number and email. 	</p>
