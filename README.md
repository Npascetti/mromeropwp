Personal Website Project- An exercise in front end web design and development.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work here - your purpose/audience/goal and Persona are simple but straightforward, and very clearly defined. You've included enough detail here to begin the design phase for a simple portfolio site to accompany a job search targeting opportunities at small-mid size independent software firms. 

There are many ways that you can illustrate your skill level and history that can be both informative and visually engaging. The use of iconography and color along with simple and clear text content can be a simple way to add visual impact and a professional "polish" that might be a nice highlight of front end skill. Engaging design can be as simple as using one or _maybe_ two colors, a nice font, good quality content, and an image. It's really all about balance. Many beautiful examples can be found just by google searching "_web developer portfolio_". [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is an great (and easy) way to incorporate iconography.

Your project looks great here - and I can see you've successfully wrestled the CSS into the ground. I can only imagine that it took a while to get this right, and was probably a little bit frustrating to get this to work! You've got a beautiful result, but there is definitely a better approach to adding the background image by using the `background` CSS property instead of using the `<img>` tag. We'll begin coverage of CSS this week!

There is one major error with the HTML: the entire `<header>` tag and all it's contents should be inside the `<body>`.

Overall - nice work here. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
These wireframes are good start. There are some issues with scale and alignment, but overall they illustrate the general direction for your UI. 

When I talk about scale, I mean the size and proportions put on the UI elements themselves. Things are looking good scale-wise on mobile, but the page headings are looking a bit small on the desktop layout. I would also make sure the elements are aligned and spaced consistently on desktop too.

On the mobile view, the only area I would consider altering is the text content around the contact form. It may be a bit narrow on extra-small screens - so just be careful there.

Bootstrap has a built-in image carousel that you can use, but I think there are better 3rd party open-source options out there like the [Owl Carousel 2](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) or [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/). These are swipe enabled on mobile too. 

An alternative approach to a carousel for your Portfolio section could be to include image thumbnails that pop up into a lightbox gallery. I mention it because sometimes image sliders don't work out as planned. [FancyBox 3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) provides a good plugin.

Overall it looks like you have a clear direction for your project layout. Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP.
