Personal Website Project- An exercise in front end web design and development.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work here - your purpose/audience/goal and Persona are simple but straightforward, and very clearly defined. You've included enough detail here to begin the design phase for a simple portfolio site to accompany a job search targeting opportunities at small-mid size independent software firms. 

There are many ways that you can illustrate your skill level and history that can be both informative and visually engaging. The use of iconography and color along with simple and clear text content can be a simple way to add visual impact and a professional "polish" that might be a nice highlight of front end skill. Engaging design can be as simple as using one or _maybe_ two colors, a nice font, good quality content, and an image. It's really all about balance. Many beautiful examples can be found just by google searching "_web developer portfolio_". [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is an great (and easy) way to incorporate iconography.

Your project looks great here - and I can see you've successfully wrestled the CSS into the ground. I can only imagine that it took a while to get this right, and was probably a little bit frustrating to get this to work! You've got a beautiful result, but there is definitely a better approach to adding the background image by using the `background` CSS property instead of using the `<img>` tag. We'll begin coverage of CSS this week!

There is one major error with the HTML: the entire `<header>` tag and all it's contents should be inside the `<body>`.

Overall - nice work here. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
